                Modernizing an Application to Investigate Fraudulent Activities more Efficiently
            </h6>
            <p>
                The Labor Law Pro (LLP) application focused on modernizing an outdated government application for Kentucky’s Education and Labor Cabinet (ELC) used to investigate companies illegally reporting employee wages and hours. The final product created a more intuitive, efficient, and accessible tool for government staff, saving time, resources, and costs to complete investigations.

                The Current Application Has Limited Functionality, Accessibility Issues, and is Unengaging
            </h6>
            <p>
                Staff investigating illegal wage and hour reporting are hindered by an outdated, visually unappealing, and poorly accessible application that lacks critical functionality. This limits their ability to investigate and act on cases efficiently, resulting in unnecessary time spent on tasks, delays in enforcement actions, and additional resources and costs.

                </h6>
                <p>
                    The application lacks essential features like generating forms or having a document library required for thorough investigations. This forced staff to rely on manual workarounds or supplementary tools leading to inefficiencies and an increase in the time and effort needed to complete investigations.

                    Poor Accessibility and Usability
                </h6>
                <p>
                    Investigators relied on two separate applications with a difficult sign-up and validation process creating barriers for staff who need quick, reliable access to conduct investigations. We also found that the main application did not meet WCAG accessibility standards, hindering our investigators, reducing productivity, and increasing incomplete or delayed investigations.

                    The bland, outdated design of the interface lacks visual hierarchy and a guided user flow, making it challenging for users to navigate and prioritize tasks effectively. This results in a poor user experience that decreases job satisfaction and contributes to a lower adoption of the tool.

                User Flow Development
            </h6>
            <p>
                After understanding our users' needs, I developed user flows that prioritized ease of navigation, accessibility, and inclusion of the desired functionality. After presenting the user flows and gathering feedback from our users, I refined, iterated, and finalized the user flows to ensure the team was all on the same page. View two of the many user flows below.

                Sketching, Iterating, and Wire-Framing
            </h6>
            <p>
                Sketching and iterating became the name of the game in finding a layout and flow that would accommodate our users' needs. After iterating, presenting, and getting more feedback on the preferred design direction, we landed on a design that I would develop into a high-fidelity prototype.

                    While building the application, it became apparent that developers needed to be involved sooner in the design process. If I were to go back and do it again, having them collaborate more with me and the stakeholders would’ve helped us streamline development and understand any limitations before designing.
