                ARROW is an application built to easily search, retrieve, and compile Kentucky Unemployment Insurance claimant data from various databases. The application is currently utilized by The Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) Benefits and Tax branches and will be utilized by other states to help them decrease time spent on retrieving claimant data, create a singular platform to get the required data, and ultimately cut down on additional resources needed to perform job tasks.

                    After we started designing, it became apparent from staff that their process and use cases didn’t all line up. While we were able to adapt and re-design to fit every users needs, it would’ve saved valuable time and resources to do more thorough research to ensure every users needs were being met.

                    While this application can be adopted by other states, we didn’t have the time or budget to consider other states direct use cases for this. If permitted, I would’ve looped other key state stakeholders to get a bigger picture of how we could make the application functional and optimal for everyone.
